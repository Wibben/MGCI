Enums are basically a way to make things clearer by using words to represent values

Usage in the program: Age, Domain and Group, they are in the Life class

Age: 0 - baby, 1 - juvenile, 2 - adult, 3 - old
Domain: 0 - air, 1 - water, 2 - land
Group: 0 - alone, 1 - small, 2 - large

It's too much hassle to remember the numbers, so when youre checking for Domain or Group of a dino use:

if(dino.getAge()==Age.BABY) (BABY can be substituted by JUVENILE, ADULT, and OLD)
if(dino.getDomain()==Domain.AIR) (AIR can be substituted by WATER and LAND)
or
if(dino.getGroup()==Group.ALONE) (ALONE can be substituted by SMALL and LARGE)


To get the integer values as described above, use

dino.getAge().value(), dino.getDomain().value() or dino.getGroup().value()

******************
NOTE: Use the enums to do anything with age, domain and group now

SPECIAL: Age has a next() method which will move to the next age, to use it, do
age = age.next();
